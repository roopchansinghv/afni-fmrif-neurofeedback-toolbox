## Python scripts and modules to enable communication with AFNI's real-time data interface to facilitate neuro-feedback
## experiments

This project contains both code to communicate with AFNI's real-time interface via network, and example code to do simple
processing and stimulus generation, based on the received data.

The communication is handled by the `afniInterfaceRT` module, and the shipping demonstration experiment is implemented using
[PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org).
